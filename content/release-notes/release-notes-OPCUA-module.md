Adapter Framework [!include[framework-version](../main/shared-content/_includes/inline/framework-version.md)]

## Overview

AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA collects time series data and relevant metadata from an OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) server and sends it to configured "Open MessageFormat (OMF) endpoints such as PI Web API and AVEVA Data Hub. AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA can also collect health and diagnostics information. It supports buffering, unsolicited data collection, on-demand discovery of available data items on a data source, on-demand or automatic history recovery of data items, and various Windows and Linux-based operating systems as well as containerization.

For more information see [AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA overview](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUAOverview).

## Fixes and enhancements

### Fixes

The following issues reported from earlier versions are fixed in this release.

- Data collection for the OPC UA server data items will no longer be skipped when the source OPC UA Server has invalid data item attributes like: DataType, Description, BrowseName, DisplayName, UserAccessLevel.
- History recovery starttime and endtime supplied in local time format will be treated as a local time by the adapter node instead of the UTC time.
- The OpcUa Data Type 'UtcTime' is now supported as a DateTime type.

### Enhancements

The following enhancements are added in this release.

- Reduce load on OPC UA server during history recovery by caching user access level.
- Enhanced logged messages to include status code in hexadecimal instead of decimal and aliased data types.
- Manage edge system configuration secrets in a centralized location while keeping backward compatibility.
- Exclude read-only facets from top level configuration in Get request.
- Increase the payload size to 64MB.
- No longer log and throw System.InvalidOperationException when the same component is added multiple times.
- The DeviceStatus value "NotConfigured" has been changed to "Not Configured."

## Security information and guidance

### OSIsoft's commitment

Because the PI System often serves as a barrier protecting control system networks and mission-critical infrastructure assets, OSIsoft is committed to (1) delivering a high-quality product and (2) communicating clearly what security issues have been addressed. This release of AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA is the highest quality and most secure version of the AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA released to date. OSIsoft's commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further.

### Vulnerability communication

The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered vulnerabilities is consistent with the [Common Industrial Control System Vulnerability Disclosure Framework](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/ICSJWG-Archive/ICSJWG_Vulnerability_Disclosure_Framework_Final_1.pdf) developed by the [Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG). Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, OSIsoft is sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection.

For more information, refer to [OSIsoft's Ethical Disclosure Policy](https://www.osisoft.com/ethical-disclosure-policy).

To report a security vulnerability, refer to [OSIsoft's Report a Security Vulnerability](https://www.osisoft.com/report-a-security-vulnerability).

### Vulnerability scoring

OSIsoft has selected the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. To calculate the CVSS scores, OSIsoft uses the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD) calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&amp;version=2) maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  OSIsoft uses Critical, High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This removes some of the opinion-related errors of CVSS scoring.  As noted in the [CVSS specification](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document), Base scores range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity.

### Overview of new vulnerabilities found or fixed

This section is intended to provide relevant security-related information to guide your installation or upgrade decision. OSIsoft is proactively disclosing aggregate information about the number and severity of AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA security vulnerabilities that are fixed in this release.
