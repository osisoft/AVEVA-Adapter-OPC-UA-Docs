Client-level failover
Last UpdatedOct 29, 2023
AdaptersAVEVA Adapter for OPC UA 1.4
You can configure the adapter for failover by using client failover to register the adapter to a failover group managed by a failover endpoint. When you register the adapter to a failover group it allows the adapter to work with other adapter instances in the group as mutual backups. This minimizes the likelihood of data loss if an adapter in the group goes offline due to incidences like scheduled maintenance or an unexpected power outage.

Using client failover, you can do the following:

Register the adapter instance to a failover group managed by a failover endpoint.

Unregister the adapter instance from a failover group managed by a failover endpoint.

Perform runtime failover parameter changes such as the failover mode and failover timeout.

Query the current failover state including the failover role, last data process time, failover status and adapter state.

Note: Failover group will be created by the adapter if it does not exist on the failover endpoint.

Configure client failover
Complete the following steps to configure client failover.

Using a text editor, create a file that contains the client failover configuration in the JSON format.

For sample JSON, see the Client-level failover.

For all available parameters, see the Client-level failover.

Save the file. For example, ConfigureClientFailover.json.

Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to run a PUT command with the contents of the file to the following endpoint: http://<hostname>:<port>/api/v1/configuration/System/ClientFailover.

Note: 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value.

Example using curl:

Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located.

curl -d "@ConfigureClientFailover.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT
            "http://<hostname>:<port>/api/v1/configuration/System/ClientFailover"
         

On successful execution, the client failover change takes effect immediately during runtime.

FailoverGroupId

Required

string

The ID of the failover group to register the adapter instance in

Allowed value: any string identifier
Default value: null

Name

Optional

string

The friendly name of the failover group

Allowed value: any string value
Default value: null

Description

Optional

string

The description of the failover group

Allowed value: any string value
Default value: null

FailoverTimeout

Required

datetime

The failover timeout value of the failover group. This defines how frequently the adapter will send a heartbeat to the failover endpoint. The heartbeat will be sent at every FailoverTimeout / 2 interval

Allowed value: a string representation of date time using hh:mm:ss

Mode

Required

string

The failover mode of the registered adapter

Allowed value: Hot, Warm, Cold
For more information, see Failover Modes.

Endpoint

Required

string

The URL of a destination that supports client failover registration. Supported destinations include ADH and on-premise Failover Service

Allowed value: well-formed http or https endpoint string
Default: null

UserName

Optional

string

The username used for Basic authentication to on-premise Failover Service endpoint

Allowed value: any string
Default: null

Note: If your username contains a backslash, you must add an escape character, for example, type OilCompany\TestUser as OilCompany\\TestUser.

Password

Optional

string

The password used for Basic authentication to on-premise Failover Service endpoint

Allowed value: any string or {{<secretId>}} (see Reference Secrets)
Default: null

ClientId

Required for ADH endpoint

string

The clientId used for Bearer authentication to ADH endpoint

Allowed value: any string, can be null if the endpoint URL schema is HTTP
Default: null

ClientSecret

Required for ADH endpoint

string

The clientSecret used for Bearer authentication to ADH endpoint

Allowed value: any string or {{<secretId>}} (see Reference Secrets)
Default: null

TokenEndpoint

Optional

string

An optional token endpoint where the adapter retrieves a bearer token. When null or not specified the adapter uses a well-known Open ID URL to retrieve it

Allowed value: well-formed http or https endpoint string
Default value: null

ValidateEndpointCertificate

Optional

boolean

An optional Boolean flag where, when set to false, the adapter will disable the verification of the server certificate

Note: AVEVA strongly recommends only disabling server certificate validation for testing purposes.

Allowed value: true or false
Default value: true

Note: Failover group name, description and failover timeout cannot be changed once created. To change it the group must be deleted on the failover service side.

Failover Modes
The failover behavior outlined below corresponds to adapter instances with the 'Secondary' failover role. Available failover modes may vary based on adapter. For more information on failover role, see Failover Role.

Mode

Description

Hot

When in Hot failover mode, configured components for the Secondary adapter instance start and collect data from the data source. Collected data is buffered into the failover-specific buffer folder until the adapter instance in the Primary role has finished sending data to the destination. Data from the Secondary adapter instance is not egressed to the data endpoint(s).

Warm

When in Warm failover mode, configured components for the Secondary adapter instance start and connect to the data source but do not collect data from the data source. Since data is not being collected, data is not buffered nor egressed to the data endpoint(s).

Cold

When in Cold failover mode, none of the configured components for the Secondary adapter instance start. The adapter does not connect to nor collect data from the data source, and data is not egressed to the data endpoint(s).

Example client failover configuration
The following is an example of a complete client failover configuration.

{

   "FailoverGroupId": "FailoverGroup1", 

   "Name": "NameExample", 

   "Description": "DescriptionExample", 

   "FailoverTimeout": "00:01:00", 

   "Mode": "hot", 

   "Endpoint": "http://test-endpoint.com", 

   "UserName": "UserName1", 

   "Password": "Password1", 

   "TokenEndpoint": null, 

   "ValidateEndpointCertificate": true 

}

Note: When On Demand history recovery is required a new AVEVA Adapter instance should be configured to perform the operation. It isn't recommended to use On Demand history recovery on an Adapter instance that participates in a failover pair.

Query current failover state
You can query the current failover state with the adapter's diagnostics. Follow the instruction below to query the current failover state:

Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to run a GET command to the following endpoint: http://<hostname>:<port>/api/v1/diagnostics/FailoverState.

The following is an example of failover state returned from the adapter:

{

   "Role": "Primary", 

   "LastDataProcessedTime": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", 

   "FailoverScore": "95", 

   "AdapterState": "Running"

}

Failover Role
The current failover Role is determined by the client failover endpoint. The current failover role is visible by querying the failover state, or by looking at the failover status diagnostics streams. For more information on failover status, see Failover Status.

Role

Description

Primary

When the adapter is in the Primary role, configured components start, collect, and egress data from the data source to the data endpoint(s).

Note: While the adapter is in the Primary role, a change in Mode in the client failover configuration does not affect adapter behavior and data will continue to be egressed.

Secondary

When the adapter is in the Secondary role, adapter behavior varies based on the failover mode. For more information, see Failover Modes.

When an adapter with a valid client failover configuration registers with an endpoint and it is the only adapter registered in the group, it becomes the Primary adapter instance. If the adapter is not the only adapter registered in the client failover group, the Primary adapter instance is that with the highest FailoverScore value. For more information on FailoverScore, see Failover Status.

Health
If the adapter has health endpoints configured, the client failover configuration values Mode and FailoverGroupId are included in the static failover health data. For more information, see Failover Health.
